Using deep neural networks for semantic image segmentation, we can analyse satellite images to learn about the size of glaciers, the presence of forest fires, or the state of large coral reefs. The goal of this project is to modify these networks so that they are not only suitable for analysing single images, but can also make predictions about the future based on a series of satellite images over time. Can we e.g. predict how much a glacier will have moved and shrunk one month from now based on monthly satellite images? Or can we predict how a forest fire will spread based on aerial or satellite photos? Or what parts of a coral reef are at risk of dying based on historical satellite images?
 
We’d like to have a couple of related projects on analysing sequences of image. There’s also a group of honours bachelor students involved in a related project on tracking deforestation. Satellite images are freely available in abundance and their analysis is a topic of interest in many other fields. However, other ideas around analysing images over time are also very welcome.
