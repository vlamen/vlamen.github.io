Lack of interpretability is a key obstacle in adoption of ML models. Recent work on pre-miRNA detection has received good results. Interpreting the behavior of this model is yet to be developed. In this project we aim to develop a deep generative model that can generate (simulate) miRNA molecules form latent factors with the goal of relating these factors to biolocial aspects.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA sequences that have been implicated in many physiological processes. Furthermore, miRNAs have been shown to be important biomarkers for diseases and their mimics are tested as drug candidates.

In previous work [1][2], we propose a method that uses domain knowledge to create an efficient image representation of miRNA molecules encoding sequence, structure, and implicitly some thermodynamic information. We then use this low-level feature representation of the molecules to develop a hierarchical deep representation using a convolutional neural network model, which directly detects precursor miRNAs. With this method we achieve state-of-the-art performance on all previously used datasets. 

The developed encoding and modeling process opens possibilities for interpretability of the models’ behavior, which may lead to novel biological interpretations of miRNA genesis and targeting. The goal of this project is to utilize these findings of the discriminative modeling for development of a latent variable generative model such as conditional Variational Autoencoder that would allow us to generate miRNA molecules. Such a model would allow us to investigate the possiblity to relate these latent factors to biologically meaningful structures or processes.

We obtain  saliency maps using smoothed guided backpropagation [3]. Sensitivity analysis would allow for interpretations of the behaviour of the CNN model [4][5][6]. Can we extract understanding by interpreting these model that could potentially lead to contribution to biology?
